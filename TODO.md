Horny status effect:
- triggered on the target of a successful sex ability (some chance, let's say 50% to start)
- can also be induced by other sources, such as entrancing beauty (consider replacing dazed with horny)
- comes with stat debuffs (see dazed status effect)
- changes some enemy AI behavior (this can be slowly phased in, too much to implement all at once)
- lasts 2 turns, but can be refreshed on a re-apply

Sex ability auto-hit when:
- target is horny
- target used Embrace Sexuality (toggled ability, increases self-pleasure and induces some flat pleasure)

Defeat via climax:
- enemies have a maximum number of climaxes they can endure in a single battle before they are defeated (submits)
- number depends on max HP and resolve (most enemies will have 1 climax at most, but minibosses can have 2 or more)
- player actors can also be defeated through pleasure, but they just exit the battle with no injuries or deaths (if this is possible)
- can tie player defeat through climax to future mechanics

Own party harassement:
- having high allure runs the (small) risk of your party members sometimes using some of their AP to harrass you
- harassment includes spanking, fingering, and so on
- deals pleasure to you, potentially making you horny
