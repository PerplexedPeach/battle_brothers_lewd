Defeat via climax:
- enemies have a maximum number of climaxes they can endure in a single battle before they are defeated (submits)
- number depends on max HP and resolve (most enemies will have 1 climax at most, but minibosses can have 2 or more)
- player actors can also be defeated through pleasure, but they just exit the battle with no injuries or deaths (if this is possible)
- can tie player defeat through climax to future mechanics

Own party harassement:
- having high allure runs the (small) risk of your party members sometimes using some of their AP to harrass you
- harassment includes spanking, fingering, and so on
- deals pleasure to you, potentially making you horny

Sub/Dom mechanics distinction:
- dom reduces the chance of getting hit by lewd skills (acts like a defense of sorts)
- sub increases pleasure reflection

Enemy horny AI:
- prioritize high allure targets
- different agent per groups
    - goblin has their own that prioritize ganging up on someone already mounted, close to climax
    - orcs push each other away so prioritize getting their own target rather than someone already targetted
    - bandits/noble/southern/barbarian have similar behavior but different weights
    - unhold has some special abilities (wrestling / mating press) using their physique to overwhelm a single target

Horny ability ideas:
- enemy ability to drag (move 1 square) a woman in climax to a free square that is closer to the other enemies (so you are more easily surrounded)
- branding after you climax to enemy ability some number of times?
- deal fatigue damage

Sounds to get:
- moaning
- louder moaning
- spanking
- plapping (penetration)
- squacking (blowjob)
