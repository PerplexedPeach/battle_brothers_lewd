Defeat via climax:
- enemies have a maximum number of climaxes they can endure in a single battle before they are defeated (submits)
- number depends on max HP and resolve (most enemies will have 1 climax at most, but minibosses can have 2 or more)
- player actors can also be defeated through pleasure, but they just exit the battle with no injuries or deaths (if this is possible)
- can tie player defeat through climax to future mechanics

Own party harassement:
- having high allure runs the (small) risk of your party members sometimes using some of their AP to harrass you
- harassment includes spanking, fingering, and so on
- deals pleasure to you, potentially making you horny
